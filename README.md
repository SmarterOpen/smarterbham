# SmarterBham
The SmarterBham project
Imagine a city driven by information.  A place where decision making is supported by a city-wide sensor network that provides real time data about the state of things.  Imagine the platform that runs the network, built and owned by the citizens, measuring the things that we think are important and giving us the insights we need to make our city the best it can be. The SmarterBham project was born out of a recognition that smart cities need grassroots participation. We can combine open hardware designs with open networks, open platforms and open data policies to build a participatory smart cities future.
